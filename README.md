# 🌍 Tour Mama – Responsive Travel Landing Page

**Tour Mama** is a responsive travel landing page built with HTML5 and CSS3.
It features a clean, modern layout using Flexbox and follows a mobile-first approach.

## 🔍 What I Learned

- Used media queries for responsive design (1200px, 1024px, 640px)
- Created Flexbox layouts for banner, cards, and testimonials
- Styled custom buttons, images, and typography
- Designed balanced sections: Services, Reviews, Destinations
- Maintained spacing, font system, and color hierarchy
- Built reusable UI components with semantic HTML and clean CSS

---

## ❌ Challenges & Fixes

- Overused `<div>` tags — refactored to use semantic HTML5 tags like `<section>`, `<main>`, and `<header>`  
- Missed adding the `<meta viewport>` tag — caused responsiveness issues on mobile; now fixed  
- Inconsistent spacing across sections — resolved by defining and applying a consistent spacing system  
- Flexbox layout misalignments — corrected after re-learning alignment properties like `justify-content` and `align-items`  
- Layouts breaking on smaller screens — fixed by properly configuring media queries and responsive units
